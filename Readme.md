# State Machines for Stream Processing

Easily create state machines for processing streams of characters, tokens, 
or anything else!

This library is an implementation in Java of [my other project](https://github.com/ryanlavers/parser),
so until I get some documentation written here, see that page for more details. There's also a simple
test program in `TestMachine.java`.
